# Real-time-Social-Media-Analytics

Project Idea: Real-time Social Media Analytics Dashboard
Overview:

Build a real-time analytics dashboard that monitors social media activity for a specific hashtag. Users can authenticate using OAuth2, and the system collects and displays analytics data such as the number of tweets, likes, and retweets for a given hashtag.
Technologies:

    Express.js with TypeScript:
    Use Express.js as the backend framework and TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.

    Socket.io:
    Implement real-time updates by integrating Socket.io to push live analytics data to the client.

    Cron Jobs:
    Schedule periodic tasks using cron jobs to fetch and update social media analytics data at regular intervals.

    Redis:
    Utilize Redis as a caching layer to store and retrieve frequently accessed analytics data, reducing the load on the social media APIs.

    OAuth2:
    Implement OAuth2 authentication to allow users to log in using their social media accounts and authorize access to their data.

Features:

    User Authentication:
        Allow users to sign in using OAuth2 authentication with their social media accounts.
        Manage user sessions securely.

    Dashboard:
        Display a real-time analytics dashboard showing the number of tweets, likes, and retweets for a specific hashtag.
        Implement live updates using Socket.io to reflect changes in real-time.

    Cron Jobs for Data Updates:
        Schedule cron jobs to periodically fetch fresh analytics data from social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API).
        Update Redis cache with the latest data to serve clients quickly.

    Redis Caching:
        Use Redis to cache frequently accessed analytics data.
        Implement cache strategies to handle expiration and refresh intervals.

    Search and Filter:
        Allow users to search and filter analytics data based on time periods, hashtags, or specific social media accounts.

    Responsive UI:
        Create a responsive and user-friendly UI for the analytics dashboard.
        Visualize data using charts and graphs.

    Error Handling:
        Implement error handling mechanisms for failed API requests, authentication issues, etc.

Technologies and Tools:

    Backend: Express.js, TypeScript, Socket.io, Redis, cron
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (you may choose a frontend framework/library)
    Authentication: OAuth2 (e.g., Passport.js)
    Social Media API: Twitter API (or any other social media API you prefer)
